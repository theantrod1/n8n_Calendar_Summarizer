I leveraged Gemini AI to architect and generate this entire n8n automation workflow from scratch. The system triggers automatically every day at 5:00 AM EST, fetching my daily schedule from Google Calendar and incomplete to-dos from Google Tasks while strictly adhering to America/New_York timezone settings. I tasked the AI with writing custom Javascript to expand recurring events, sort items chronologically, and filter tasks so that only incomplete items due "today" are included. The result is a perfectly formatted, single-message agenda delivered to my Telegram each morning, streamlining my daily planning without requiring any manual input. Created on 12/23/25.
